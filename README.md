🧠 Epilepsy Detection using EEG (ML + Deep Learning)

An end-to-end intelligent system for automated epilepsy seizure detection using EEG signals, combining traditional machine learning and advanced deep learning architectures.

📌 Overview

Epilepsy is a neurological disorder affecting millions worldwide, where early and accurate detection of seizures is critical.

Manual EEG analysis is:

Time-consuming
Subjective
Error-prone

This project introduces an automated, explainable, and high-accuracy seizure detection system using both:

Machine Learning models
Deep Learning (ChronoNet + Attention mechanisms)
🚀 Key Features
✅ End-to-end EEG processing pipeline
✅ Comparison of ML vs Deep Learning models
✅ Custom AttentionChronoNet architecture
✅ High accuracy: 99.22% (best model)
✅ Reduced false negatives (critical for clinical use)
✅ Explainability using SHAP + Attention Maps
✅ Scalable for real-time and wearable applications
🏗️ System Architecture

Pipeline:

EEG Data → Preprocessing → Feature Engineering / Raw Input
        → ML Models (SVM, RF, KNN, NB)
        → Deep Learning (ChronoNet, AttentionChronoNet)
        → Evaluation + Explainability (SHAP)
📊 Dataset

🔥 Key Improvement
False negatives reduced from 32 → 10
Huge impact for real-world medical safety
🧩 Novel Contribution: AttentionChronoNet

Enhancements over standard ChronoNet:

🔹 Self-Attention Block
Captures long-range dependencies in EEG signals
🔹 Additive Attention Pooling
Uses full signal instead of last timestep
Generates interpretable importance weights
🔍 Explainability (Very Important)

To make the model clinically usable:

SHAP (Shapley Values) used for interpretation
Shows which EEG time points influenced predictions
Attention maps align with real seizure patterns
